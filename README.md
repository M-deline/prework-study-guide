# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## This project will contain details regarding the prework course from bootcamp

This project was created to be a reference to topics such as CSS, HTML, Git, and JavaScript while learning to code.  I am eager to learn to code and improve my skills for self improvement as well as career opportunities. This project has reference notes regarding HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Git. This will be very handy if I come across an error or if I need to know a specific detail in the future. This guide answers common coding questions and as a first project it will be helpful for hands on leanring as well as being there in the future. It solves any future questions that I, or any other coder, might need an answer to. I learned how to set up SSH keys and sync my Git Repo to my computer and to VS Code. I also had the opportunity to get a closer look at HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I used a guide and learned the importance of proper language and syntax as well as making sure to test and debug code as one goes. I downloaded ChromeDev to allow me to code easier. With this I connected my Git Repo to the computer and was able to edit it on VS Code while learning important terms and definitions and then I was able to sync these notes and upload them into the Git Repo by creating Issues for each category. This project taught me basic coding that I will use for the rest of my life.

## Usage

This Study Guide Webpage can be used to go over basic coding details. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. There are four main issues or categories: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each issue or category explains the definition and key terms. This is helpful when running into an unfamilar term in coding and being able to reference the notes to understand what the term is and how to write it as well as its usage. HTML shows the writing aspect on the website and the CSS is the appearance of the website like the background colars, images, and shadows. Git syncs with the website and is handy to put into issues as well as merge all the components into the main branch. JavaScript is the interactivity of a webpage and one can see it if they "inspect" the webpage and go into the console in DevTools. Everything in the JavaScript file is working to show what pops up in the website in the console.

## <PreWork Study Guide>

## Description

I am eager to learn coding and programming for self improvement and for future career opportunities. I built this website so that I, or any other coder, can reference these notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and use it if they are stuck to be able to move on and improve. I set up my computer first with SSH keys to connect with a Git Repository and I created some issues for each category listed above. Then I downloaded VS Code to be able to write the code and be able to revert and fix changes easier. This project allows anyone to see definitions of coding terms and solves any question regarding one of the categories. It could be used to help fix a bug problem in code or to help anyone wanting to learn how to code what the terms and definitions are and why we would use them. I learned how to set up my computer and access the terminal while using commands to open and create new folders. I learned how to create simple codes and worked on reverse engineering a code and debugging a code. I learned how HTML is the words and text on the website, CSS is the appearance of the website, like images, color, and any shadows. Git can be connected to this and used to upload work into repos and issues which is useful to see code and get another coderâ€™s opinion on it if needed. JavaScript is the interactivity on a website. In this project it can be seen by inspecting the page and viewing the console. The code written in the JavaScript file is running every time the page is inspected. This project was very helpful since I not only took important notes, but it was hands-on learning so I know what to expect in the future.

This guide is to be used to reference notes on basic coding aspects. To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. The website will show notes on each category including definitions and key terms.
